## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- Grid layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- Basic responsiveness

### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce my understanding of semantic HTML and CSS layout techniques like **Flexbox** and **Grid**. I also practiced CSS selectors like `nth-child()` to style specific elements, such as the numbers in the table.

Example of styling only the numbers in a table:

```css
table td:nth-child(2) {
  color: #854632;
  font-weight: bold;
}
